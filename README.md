# MNIST dimensionality reduction"
A key concept in **Machine Learning** is reducing the dimensionality of objects to the key features
This is an example with MNIST digits, 28*28 pixel hand written digits'
In this example MNIST digits are reconstructed used a Keras autoencoder with only two features in the latent space.
The impact of changing the feature values and running the decoder to reconstruct the images can be found
